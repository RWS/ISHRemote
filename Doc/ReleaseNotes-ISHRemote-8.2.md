# Release Notes of ISHRemote v8.2

High level release notes are on [Github](https://github.com/rws/ISHRemote/releases/tag/v8.2), below the most detailed release notes we have :)

**Before I forget, all people with a Github account, could you spare a moment to STAR this repository - see top-right Star icon on https://github.com/RWS/ISHRemote/ Appreciated!**


## General

This release inherits the v0.1 to v0.14 up to v8.1 development branch and features. All cmdlets and business logic are fully compatible even around authentication. In short, we expect it all to work still :)

### Remember
* All C# source code of the ISHRemote library is online at [master](https://github.com/rws/ISHRemote/tree/master/Source/ISHRemote/Trisoft.ISHRemote), including handling of the different [Connection](https://github.com/rws/ISHRemote/tree/master/Source/ISHRemote/Trisoft.ISHRemote/Connection) protocols in a NET 4.8 and NET 6.0+ style.
* All PowerShell-based Pester integration tests are located per cmdlet complying with the `*.tests.ps1` file naming convention. See for example [AddIshDocumentObj.Tests.ps1](https://github.com/rws/ISHRemote/tree/master/Source/ISHRemote/Trisoft.ISHRemote/Cmdlets/DocumentObj/AddIshDocumentObj.Tests.ps1) or [TestIshValidXml.Tests.ps1](https://github.com/rws/ISHRemote/tree/master/Source/ISHRemote/Trisoft.ISHRemote/Cmdlets/FileProcessor/TestIshValidXml.Tests.ps1)

The below text describes the delta compared to fielded release ISHRemote v8.1.


## Actively recover interactive sessions

Every usage of a cmdlet will refresh the security tokens. However, when not using ISHRemote cmdlets or the implicit `$ISHRemoteSessionStateIshSession` or explicit `$ishSession` object, the session expires by default after around 57 minutes when using ISHID or similar on other identity providers. In turn resulting in error `An unsecured or incorrectly secured fault was received from the other party. See the inner FaultException for the fault code and detail.`.

In this ISHRemote version, the session will attempt to get a new token automatically on every triggererd ISHRemote cmdlet. If you created the IShSession object over an interactive browser, you will see the browser again perhaps with or without a credential challenge in the browser. Change is only for protocols `WcfSoapWithOpenIdConnect` and `OpenApiWithOpenIdConnect`; no change for `WcfSoapWithWsTrust`.

## Known Issues

* Aborting the `New-IShSession`/`Test-IShSession` cmdlets using `Ctrl-C` in PowerShell is not possible, you have to await the non-configurable 60 seconds timeout potentially resulting in `GetTokensOverSystemBrowserAsync Error[Browser login canceled after 60 seconds.]`. Typically happens if you did not authenticate in the System Browser.
* Several Authentication known issues...
    * Authentication over System Browser, so Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE), will give you 60 seconds. Any slower and you will see the `New-IShSession`/`Test-IShSession` cmdlets respond with `TaskCanceledException` exception stating `Browser login canceled after 60 seconds.`
    * Authentication over Client Credentials Flow with non-existing `-ClientId` will error out with `GetTokensOverClientCredentialsAsync Access Error[invalid_client]; either invalid ClientId/ClientSecret combination or expired ClientSecret.`. Please make sure you activate a client/secret on your Access Management User Profile (ISHAM).
    * Authentication over Client Credentials Flow with expired `-ClientId`/`-ClientSecret` combination will error out with `GetTokensOverClientCredentialsAsync Access Error[invalid_client]; either invalid ClientId/ClientSecret combination or expired ClientSecret.`. Please recycle expired client/secret on your Access Management User Profile (ISHAM).
    * Authentication over Client Credentials Flow with valid `-ClientId`/`-ClientSecret` combination, but not mapped in the CMS to a User Profile over `FISHEXTERNALID` will `[-14] The access is denied because no profile match was found. 0`. Please make sure that the client (which you can find on the Access Management User Profile) is added in Organize Space on one CMS User Profile in the comma-seperated External Id field.
    * Authentication over Client Credentials Flow with valid `-ClientId`/`-ClientSecret` combination, and mapped in the CMS to a User Profile over `FISHEXTERNALID` which is disabled will error out with `[-6] Your account has been disabled. Please see your system administrator.`. Please make sure in Organize Space that the one CMS User Profile holding the client in the External Id field is an enabled profile.
    * Refresh Token is not used to refresh the Access Token in the background (seperate thread), it is only used to refresh when the next cmdlet is triggered before expiration. Authentication over either Client Credentials or System Browser was succesful but the Access Token expired. You do not need to create a `New-IShSession`, every cmdlet will attempt to get a token (either refresh or re-logon if required) based on the cmdlets (implicit) `-IShSession` parameter. 
* Using `New-IshSession` parameter `-PSCredential` on 14SP4/14.0.4 or earlier works like before, as it means username/password authentication over protocol `WcfSoapWithWsTrust`.  However, using `-PSCredential` on 15/15.0.0+ means that you are using protocol `WcfSoapOverOpenIdConnect`, so expecting a client/secret. If you then provide username/password, you will get error `GetTokensOverClientCredentialsAsync Access Error[invalid_client]`. Note that you can force by adding `-Protocol WcfSoapWithWsTrust` to the `New-IshSession` cmdlet.
* On the Github Actions container-based build I received error `Could not load file or assembly 'System.ServiceModel.Primitives, Version=4.10.2.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.`. This PowerShell 7.2.x issue is seemingly resolved since 7.3.6 as mentioned [here](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf/issues/2862) and has to do with loading .NET Standard libaries in platform libraries (like Trisoft.ISHRemote.dll). Therefor extended the `continuous-integration.yml` to upgrade to PowerShell Preview using [pwshupdater](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pwshupdater).


## Quality Assurance

Added more Invoke-Pester 5.7.1 Tests, see Github actions for the Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.5+ hosts where
* the skipped are about SslPolicyErrors testing
* the failed are about IMetadata bound fields (issue #58)

Below is not an official performance compare, but a recurring thing noticed along the way. Using the same client machine, same ISHRemote build and same backend but different PowerShell hosts we noticed a considerable speed up of the Pester tests. However, adding (complicated) tests along the way and knowing that ISHRemote as client library greatly depends on the server-side load, we have to take these numbers at face value.
