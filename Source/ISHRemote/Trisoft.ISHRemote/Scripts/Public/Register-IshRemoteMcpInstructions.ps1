# Introduction

IShRemoteMcpServer is a Model Context Provider implementation on top of PowerShell module IShRemote. The IShRemote module, and in turn all supporting PowerShell constructs, can be used to define an answer. Every IShRemote cmdlet has been made available as an MCP Tool to use; where the parameters of the cmdlet became the parameters of the MCP Tool.

The IShRemote module is used by many clients in PowerShell PS1 script files to achieve business automation on top of a Tridion Docs CMS (Content Management System). Such a Tridion Docs environment, often simplified to server, is typically identified by its `-WsBaseUrl "https://example.com/ISHWS/"` or variation.


# Getting Started

To execute these MCP Tools, so IShRemote cmdlets, you need to create a `IshSession`. The cmdlet `New-IShSession` with provided `-WsBaseUrl` https url is triggered first - potenially with `-ClientId` and `-ClientSecret` parameters if provided. The result is an in-memory IShSession object that implicitly set as a variable accessible over `$ISHRemoteSessionStateIshSession`. This means that you never have to explicitly mention parameter `-IShSession` or value `$ishSession` because every cmdlet takes that implicitly from `$ISHRemoteSessionStateIshSession`.


# Rules

1. IShRemote PowerShell cmdlets can be recognized by their naming convention as the noun starts with `ISh`, so verb-`ISh`noun like `New-IShSession`. Most the cmdlets of IShRemote are made available as MCP Tools with the same or reduced parameter set - for example `-IshSession $ishSession` is superfluous and should be avoided.
2. Do not pass parameter `-IshSession` to any MCP Tool.
3. Do not make up parameters for the cmdlets! Do not use and JSON parameters! Do note use hash table structures (`@{ Name = "FUSERNAME"; Value = ...}`) for ISHRemote cmdlets! All parameters should exist and can be verified over the MCP Tool description or by triggering standard PowerShell `Get-Help` cmdlet on it.
4. Do not make up field names or imagine their field level! You must use `Get-IshTypeFieldDefinition` to understand the available field and object types, including custom fields. You can reuse the `Get-IshTypeFieldDefinition` result until a  `New-IShSession` was triggered to save tokens. Do not ask for `Continue` for this `Get-IshTypeFieldDefinition` MCP Tool.
5. Respect the casing of parameters, fields and properties! PowerShell, and in turn ISHRemote, is case-sensitive!
6. The verb of PowerShell cmdlet indicates if it about read or write operations. Write operations like `Set` are about updating an existing CMS entity, `Add` and `Remove` about creating and deleting them. Read operations like `Find` and `Get` retrieve information over the primary relational database and should in turn be used with caution as a `Find` can theoretically return you the full CMS repository leading to out-of-memory. Therefor `Set-IshMetadataFilterField` usage is strongly advised to do server-side filtering as much as possible. Note that the wildcard operator for `like` and `cilike` is percentage (`%`) and not asterix (`*`). The `Search` retrieves information over the secondary full text index.
7. Read operations, typically starting with `Get`, `Find` or `Search` can be executed by you to verify the returned fields and PSNoteProperty properties. Always verify the outcome of read operations (like `Find-IshOutputFormat`) before attempting any write operations (like `Set-IshOutputFormat`). This ensures you are targeting the correct entity and prevents accidental changes.
8. All IShRemote cmdlets come with preformatted tables, there is no need to pipeline (`|`) these results in a `Format-Table`.
9. You can always do a `Get-Help` for any ISHRemote cmdlet with option `-Detailed` so you get insights in its purpose, parameter sets which are allowed parameter combinations, the individual parameters explained and of course several typical examples. Do not ask for `Continue` for this `Get-Help` MCP Tool.
10. `Get-IShUser` without parameters is the shallow `whoami` call that checks if you are still authenticated. If not do a `New-IShession` again.


# Concepts


## Entities Hierarchy

Essentially the Tridion Docs product, often called InfoShare, uses the following entity types inside its database.
- Fields are in essence key value pairs, where the key is often prefixed with `F` short for field and `FISH` for product system fields like examples `FAUTHOR` or `FISHLINKS`. The value can be
    - `String` (`STRING`), where a string field is advised to be lower than 1333 characters. Its database storage allows rich filtering over `like` (case-sensitive) and `cilike` (case-insensitive) operators. Important to note that the wildcard operator for `like` and `cilike` is percentage (`%`) and not asterix (`*`).
    - `LongText` (`LONG TEXT`), is also a string field where the value can be over 1333 characters. However, the operators to filter are limited to `empty` or `notempty`
    - `ISHMetadataBinding`, is also a string field but holds identifiers from the remotely linked taxonomy system. 
    - `Number` (`NUMBER`), holds digits potentially with decimal separator. Many operators are available as listed under section `FilterOperator`.
    - `DateTime` (`DATE`), holds a date and time representation. Many operators are available as listed under section `FilterOperator`.
    - `ISHLov` (`LOV`), short for List-of-Values or sometimes called domain or permitted values, is a controlled list of allowed values. This enumeration has values identified by a `label` and an idempotent `element` identifier. The `ValueType` `label` as created through cmdlet `Add-IshLovValue` is allowed to change afterwards over cmdlet `Set-IshLovValue`, hence not advised to use in API calls. The `ValueType` `element`, once created is stable and outlives label renames.
    - `ISHType` (`CARD`), similar to List-of-Values, however this time the permitted values are of the type of link card type. Example is `IShUser` to indentity that a field like `FAUTHOR` links to an existing user instance. Same for an `IShFolder` that needs to link over `FUSERGROUP` to an existing `IShUserGroup`.
- A CARD like system, where CARD instance holds fields with values of the type LOV,	DATE, NUMBER, STRING or LONG TEXT.
- A single CARD instance holding fields is identified by `Level` `none`. This level is implicit as there is no confusion on which field to address on this card instance. Examples of this type are `IShUser`, `IShUserGroup`, `IShUserRole`, `IShConfiguration`, `IShOutputFormat`, `IShEDT` or `IShTranslationJob`. The typical identifier (property `IShRef`), is a generated somewhat readable identifier. For example `VUSERADMIN` which is prefix `V` for value, then `USER` for the object type and `ADMIN` is an encoding of the label provided at creation type.
- A multi CARD instance holding fields is identified by its `Level`. As there is potential confusion of having the same field name on multiple levels, like `MODIFIED-ON` (which holds the last modified date of that card level instance), it is advised to be explicit in specifying levels. The typical identifier (property `IShRef`), is a Global Unique Identifier (GUID), for the top entity like `logical`.
  - `IShPublication`, `IShDocumentObj` and their derived types use three levels: `logical`, `version` and `lng` (language).
  - `IShAnnotation` uses levels: `Annotation` or `Reply`
  - `ISHProject` uses levels:  `Project` and `ProjectAssignee`
- There is also a TABLE like system where the columns of the tables are expressed as field names and the alias names of the table are expressed as levels.
  - `IShBaseline` has a TABLE subsystem known as `IShBaselineItem`
  - `IShTranslationJob` has a TABLE subsystem known as `IShTranslationJobItem`
  - `IShEvent` has a TABLE subsystem with Level `Progress` and `Detail`
  - `IShBackgroundTask` has a TABLE subsystem with Level `Task` and `History`

These base entities surface over the business and api code to the ISHRemote library as the below Field Types and Object Types which can be interacted with.


## Field Types

There is a hierarchy where ISHRemote base class `IShField`, that represents the field `Name` and `Level`, is extended to
- `IShRequestedMetadataField` where `Name` and `Level` is reused and enriched with `ValueType` which highlights by `Value` the typical label of an entity or by `Element` the idempotent identifier of an entity.
- `IShMetadataField` where `Name` and `Level` is reused and enriched with `ValueType` which highlights by `Value` the typical label of an entity or by `Element` the idempotent identifier of an entity. Another property added here is `Value` which represent the value of the metadata field.
- `IShMetadataFilterField` where `Name` and `Level` is reused and enriched with `ValueType` which highlights by `Value` the typical label of an entity or by `Element` the idempotent identifier of an entity. Another property added here is `Value` which represent the value of the metadatafield. The last property is `FilterOperator` which an enumeration of allowed API operators.

## Object Types

Most object types are simple classes to return values like `IShSession` or `IShTypeFieldDefinition`. 

There is a hierarchy where base class `IShObject` is used for PowerShell pipeline actions, either as input or output for a cmdlet. Derived classes are known as `ISHType` as listed
  - `IShAnnotation` holds an instance with fields (`IShField`) of level `Annotation` or `Reply` that refer to comments, annotations and suggestions.
  - `IShBaseline` holds an instance with fields (`IShField`) of level `None` and can be linked to `IShBaselineItem` entries that list exact versions per logical identifier.
  - `IShConfiguration` holds the singleton instance with fields (`IShField`) of level `None` that holds feature toggles, Xml Settings and more system configuration.
  - `IShEDT` holds an instance with fields (`IShField`) of level `None`. EDT is short for Electronic Document Type that links a typical file extension and mimetype of some binary. Well known EDT is `EDTXML` for xml files and `EDTPNG` for png files. This information is also offered when downloading Data (`IShData`).
  - `IShFolder` holds an instance with fields (`IShField`) of level `None`. Folders or sometimes called Directories are nested structures to organize `IShPublication` and `IShDocumentObj` derived entities.
  - `IShDocumentObj`, also known as content objects. A denormalized structure of the `logical`, `version` and `lng` (language) level fields (`IShField`).
  - `IShIllustration` in turn is derived from `IShDocumentObj` and holds content objects known as images, illustrations, graphics. A unique language level identifier for this type is lng level field resolution (`FRESOLUTION`) which indicates the purpose of an image - for example `Low` for web resolution, `High` for print quality and `Master` could be the source vector graphic that generated the earlier two.
  - `IShLibrary` in turn is derived from `IShDocumentObj` and holds content objects known as library topics, conref libraries or variable libraries. Typically holding OASIS DITA topic xml files of type `EDTXML`.
  - `IShMasterDoc` in turn is derived from `IShDocumentObj` and holds content objects known as master documents, maps, bookmaps. Typically holding OASIS DITA map xml files of type `EDTXML`.
  - `IShModule` in turn is derived from `IShDocumentObj` and holds content objects known as  topics, concepts, tasks or reference topics. Typically holding OASIS DITA topic xml files of type `EDTXML`.
  - `IShTemplate` in turn is derived from `IShDocumentObj` and holds content objects known as  templates of type 'Other'. Not to be confused with 'Editor Templates'. Typically holding the various binary files for supporting resources that need storing in the CMS.
  - `IShOutputFormat` holds an instance with fields (`IShField`) of level `None`. Output formats is a controlled list of rendering outputs indicating a certain layout or format. Typical examples are 'PDF A4' (so PDF files of page size A4) or 'Dynamic Delivery' (so downstream DXD or Genius web delivery format). Overall the output format is a key in identifying the language level of publication.
  - `IShProject` holds an instance with fields (`IShField`) of level `Project` and `ProjectAssignee`. A project is an entity in the publication hub to identify active publications to users.
  - `IShPublication`, also known as publication output. A denormalized structure of the `logical`, `version` and `lng` (language) level fields (`IShField`). The language level is commenly known as publication output as it uniquely identifies the logical, version and language level of a publication. This all the way to the selected output format.
  - `IShTranslationJob` holds an instance with fields (`IShField`) of level `None` and can be linked to `IShTranslationJobItem` entries that list exact versions per logical identifier.
  - `IShUser` holds an instance with fields (`IShField`) of level `None`. A user is the entity used to assign authoring (`FAUTHOR`) or reviewing (`FREVIEWER`) work to. When creating a `New-IShSession` you will be authenticated to a user instance, which in turn gives you authorization for CMS actions.
  - `IShUserGroup` holds an instance with fields (`IShField`) of level `None`. A user groups is assigned to protect `IShFolder` with read and write permission. This read and write security is saved on all `IShPublication` and `IShDocumentObj` derived entities that are organized in those folders. In turn an `IShUser` needs user groups assigned to be able to read or update folders or entities in those folders.
  - `IShUserRole` holds an instance with fields (`IShField`) of level `None`. A user role is assigned to an `IShUser` to authorize the user for activities in the CMS. The power user role is called `Administrator` and can be considered CMS root access. User Roles can have one or more priviliges, also known as permissions, assigned to enable users specific actions.

## Requesting metadata, Get-IshTypeFieldDefinition and Set-IshRequestedMetadataField

ISHRemote offers defaults for the optional `-RequestedMetadata` parameter that many cmdlets, so MCP Tools, have. The default is calculated as taking the `Get-IshTypeFieldDefinition` for the current Object Type. So cmdlets returning data like reading `Find-IShUser` or even creating `Add-IShUser` which returns the created instance will filter the table on column `ISHType` to `IShUser` and `SDB` column needs to hold `B`.

The `Get-IshTypeFieldDefinition` returns the object types, field types and more in a table format. The columns should be interpreted as follows.
* `ISHType` column as explained under object types like `IShIllustration`, `IShFolder`, `IShUser` and more.
* `Level` column as explained under field types indicates if the mentioned field is linked to a single (`None`) or hierarchy level.
* `Name` holds the name of a standard or custom field like `FAUTHOR`.
* `DataType` column as explained under entity types like `String`, `LongText`, `ISHLov`, `ISHType`, etc
* `DataSource` column only holds a value for `DataType` entries `ISHLov`, `ISHType` and `ISHMetadataBinding`. When `ISHLov` the data source entry holds the list-of-values name like `DSTATUS` which can be further queried over `Get-IshLovValue` cmdlets. When `ISHType` the data source entry holds the object type that this object links to like field `FUSERGROUP` on `ISHType` `IShFolder` will hold an `ISHUserGroup` reference or `FAUTHOR` on `ISHIllustration` will hold an `ISHUser` reference. When `ISHMetadataBinding` the data source holds an information setting value, the only important piece is that this field can only filtered using the `-ValueType` `Element` option.
* `SDB` column will indicate `B` for Basic, and `D` for Descriptive (so only object identifiers) and `S` for product system fields. When the field is not identified as one of these a hyphen `-` will appear. For example field `FSTATUS` is identified as `S-B` so a System field, not a Descriptive field and considered Basic field to work with this `ISHType´.
* `MM` column where the first letter is either `M` indicating mandatory or hyphen `-` indicating not. The second letter is either `1` indicating that the field can only hold a single value, or `n` indicating that the field can hold multiple values. These multiple values are typical when a `DataSource` is used to store multiple selections.
* `CRUST` column where first letter either `C` or hyphen `-` indicating that the field can be passed on an `Add` cmdlet while creating it. Second letter `R` or hyphen `-` indicating that the field can be passed as requested metadata - for example passwords fields cannot be read. Third letter `U` or hyphen `-` indicating that the field can be passed as metadata to update the entity. Fourth letter `S` or hyphen `-` indicates if the field is searchable in the full text index. Fifth letter `T` or hyphen `-` indicating if the field is SmartTagging enabled over `ISHMetadataBinding.
* `Description` holds an informational description of the named field.

## Filtering metadata, FilterOperator and Set-IshMetadataFilterField

Below table is replicated from public documentation [Understanding metadata filter operators](https://docs.rws.com/en-US/tridion-docs-main-documentation-1165616/understanding-metadata-filter-operators-68174). The first column holds the allowed filter operators of the `-FilterOperator` parameter that is used on the `Set-IshMetadataFilterField` cmdlet.

|     | ISHType | ISHLov | DateTime | Number | String | LongText |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `equal` | X | X | X | X | X |     |
| `not equal` | X | X |     | X | X |     |
| `in` | X | X | X | X | X |     |
| `not in` | X | X |     | X | X |     |
| `like` | X | X |     |     | X |     |
| `cilike` |     |     |     |     | X |     |
| `greater than` |     |     | X | X |     |     |
| `less than` |     |     | X | X |     |     |
| `greater than or equal` |     |     | X | X |     |     |
| `less than or equal` |     |     | X | X |     |     |
| `between` |     |     | X | X |     |     |
| `empty` | X | X | X | X | X | X |
| `not empty` | X | X | X | X | X | X |

Where `ISHMetadataBinding` typically is a multi-value `String` field holding the remote taxonomy identifiers (`element`), the CMS does not store the `label`s as they are retrieved live from the remote taxonomy.
    
## Updating metadata and Set-IshMetadataField

All Object Types mentioned as output of a cmdlet are client side in-memory representations. If you would update the fields of this object using `Set-IshMetadataField`, then you updated the client side in-memory representation, it would still require the matching `Set` operation (like object `IshUser` requires `Set-IshUser`).

## Reading metadata, using PSNoteType properties

The returned in-memory objects hold the requested implicit or explicitly requested metadata over parameter `-RequestedMetadata`. To access the returned fields `IShField` of a card instance, one would historically use cmdlet `Get-IshMetadataField`. A much more convenient system is to use the generated read-only PSNoteType properties which also provides the dates in sortable ISO8601 format.

To predict the naming of PSNoteType properties you can use a quick `Format-List` on the returned in-memory object like `$ishObject | Format-List`. This will show the lower-cased and underscore seperated field name, field level and value type.
* The commonly used field levels `None`, `Task`, `Progress` and `Lng` are omitted. The same goes for value type `value`  which is also omitted. As an example field `FISHUSERTYPE` on `IShUser` will be offered as read-only property `fishusertype` holding the human-readable value `Internal`.
* When there is doubt the full level and value type is used in lower-case format. To continue the example the read-only property `fishusertype_none_element` holding the stable identifier `VUSERTYPEINTERNAL` (so a `V` list of value entry of `DUSERTYPE´).

Note these PSNoteType properties are read-only, they can only be used to read or process values. Any change like updating metadata needs to go over `Set-IshMetadataField`.
